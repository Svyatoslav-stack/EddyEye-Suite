# Overview

The **EddyEye Suite** platform combines three core modules into a unified monitoring and analytics system for **Eddy Covariance data**:

- **EddyEye Hub**: dashboard **updates daily** in the early morning and stores a full week of HF, LF, and EddyPro data. Designed for scientists to analyze ecosystem flux dynamics over a weekly timescale and perform data summarization.
- **EddyEye Map**: real-time map interface that **updates every minute**, showing the status of all stations and their data flows. Primarily used by technicians for quick issue detection and resolution.
- **EddyEye Pulse**: dashboard **updates every 30 minutes**, containing one day of data for rapid detection of operational issues such as power outages, sensor interference, or logger failures.
